When sale adverts then reasonably have to be relied \nupon to ascertain a fair market value for an older vehicle, there are also likely less examples \non the market to review. Further, for motorhomes in particular, the exact features and \ncondition of things like the upholstery, can have a marked impact on the price \u2013 with those \ntype of details not always being apparent in sale adverts.

But I think that evidence is \nsomewhat limited \u2013 the screenshots don\u2019t show the whole advert, including the basic detail \nof the motorhomes for sale, let alone any key features.

And that not having access to a \nmotorhome has impacted them. I\u2019m not persuaded though, that West Bay\u2019s settlement was \nso limited as to have reasonably prevented them from replacing the motorhome. I think it\u2019s \nmore likely that the lack of availability of similar aged motorhomes (over 20 years old) in the \nmarket place has made it difficult to find a replacement at a value near that paid by West \nBay, or even near the increased amount I have awarded.

West Bay said it felt its offer had been fair and reasonable. Regarding the adverts it had \npreviously relied upon, it said that all three were right-hand drive vehicles, and younger \nmodels than that owned by Mr F and Miss R, with one having substantially less mileage on \nthe clock. So they\u2019d all likely demand a higher price in the market than Mr F and Miss R\u2019s \nleft-hand drive, older and more travelled motorhome.

None of the cropped adverts \ncontained any of the important information details often listed within sale adverts like this.

The question asks how West Bay allegedly failed in settling the claim fairly and reasonably. To answer this, we need to look at the context where it discusses the actions of West Bay in relation to the claim settlement.\n\n2. The context mentions that West Bay had two engineers consider the fair and reasonable market value for the motorhome. However, the evidence provided to support this value was limited. This is highlighted in the context: ##begin_quote##\"But I think that evidence is somewhat limited \u2013 the screenshots don\u2019t show the whole advert, including the basic detail of the motorhomes for sale, let alone any key features.\"##end_quote##\n\n3. The context also mentions that no reasoning was given by the engineers to explain why they felt the adverts showed motorhomes comparable to the claimants' motorhome.

The question asks why West Bay should pay Mr F and Miss R the updated sum. To answer this, we need to understand the context of the dispute and the reasoning behind the decision.\n2. The context reveals that the dispute is about the market value of Mr F and Miss R's motorhome. West Bay had initially valued it at \u00a31,666, which Mr F and Miss R disagreed with.\n3. The decision maker took an average of three values (\u00a316,995, \u00a316,995 and \u00a321,995) to determine a fair market value for the motorhome. This average came out to be \u00a318,661, which is significantly higher than West Bay's initial valuation.\n4. ##begin_quote##\"That is an increase from West Bay\u2019s value of \u00a31,666. I think West Bay should pay this sum to Mr F and Miss R, plus interest* from the date of the original settlement until payment is made.\"##end_quote##\n5. The decision maker also considered the impact of not having access to a motorhome on Mr F and Miss R, and the difficulty they faced in finding a replacement due to the lack of availability of similar aged motorhomes in the market.\n6. However, the decision maker did not find it fair or reasonable to award compensation for distress and inconvenience caused by West Bay's unfair and unreasonable market value settlement.\n7. The decision maker also considered West Bay's argument about the motorhome's age, mileage, and upgrades, but found that the evidence presented by West Bay was not clear or sufficient.\n\nFinal Answer: West Bay was deemed to pay Mr F and Miss R the updated sum because the decision maker determined that the fair market value of their motorhome was \u00a318,661, which was significantly higher than West Bay's initial valuation of \u00a31,666.

I remain of the view that West Bay had not \nfairly and reasonably settled the claim with its payment based on a market value of \u00a316,995. Having considered West Bay\u2019s objection to my provisional decision, I\u2019m not minded to \nchange my views on it. Either in respect of West Bay not having made a fair and reasonable \nsettlement or that to resolve this a further payment of \u00a31,666, plus interest should be paid by \nit. My provisional findings, along with my comments here, are now the findings of this, my \nfinal decision. Putting things right\nI require West Bay to pay Mr F and Miss R:\n\uf0b7\u00a31,666, plus interest* from the date the original settlement was paid until this further \npayment is made.*Interest is at a rate of 8% simple per year and paid on the amounts specified and from\/to \nthe dates stated. HM Revenue & Customs may require West Bay to take tax from this \ninterest.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>If asked, it must give Mr F and Miss R a certificate showing how much tax has been \ntaken off. My final decision\nI uphold this complaint. I require West Bay Insurance Plc to provide the redress set out \nabove at \u201cPutting things right\u201d. Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, I\u2019m required to ask Mr F and Miss R to \naccept or reject my decision before 25 August 2023.

So they\u2019d all likely demand a higher price in the market than Mr F and Miss R\u2019s \nleft-hand drive, older and more travelled motorhome.

When West By presented its file detail to us it showed us three cropped photos of sales \nadverts. In the main the cropped adverts showed one photo of the motorhome for sale, a few \nsmaller thumbnails and a header detailing what was for sale. None of the cropped adverts \ncontained any of the important information details often listed within sale adverts like this. Whilst I note what West Bay is now saying about these adverts, it\u2019s not clear to me from the \nphotos if all three of these examples were right-hand drive.
